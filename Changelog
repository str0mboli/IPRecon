  Addressed IPv6 bug. IPRecon should now recognize compressed notation properly.
  Added a clear results button.
  Added a results output pane that formats IPs so that they are KQL query friendly.
  New Dependency: cryptography.
  Added Fernet encryption: This encrypts the API key using machine-based information.
    The encrypted API key will only function on the device it was entered into. No more clear text API keys.
  New App Icon.
  RPReconBanner.png should now compile with the .exe and no longer be stored as a separate file when using the updated pyinstaller command.
  Updated Version to v1.02

3/24/2025
  Released RP Recon NF Edition: This edition uses non-stored password based AES encryption instead of fernet. 
  This should be more friendly to managed devices that may not appreciate IP Recon using machine statistics as an encryption key.
